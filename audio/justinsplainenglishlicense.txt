You can use the files in the distributed package for commercial or open source projects.
The files in this package can not be resold or redistributed as is, or with only trivial modifications.
However the files in this package can be redistributed or resold as part of another product or package as long as that product is not another SDK.

If you did not pay a fee for the use of the files in this package to Justin Hunt from PoodLL.com, you should not be developing with them. If you did pay, please make something useful and cool. Thanks.
