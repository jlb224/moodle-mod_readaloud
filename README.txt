Read Aloud Module for Moodle
=============

ReadAloud is an online testing system designed to assist teachers in evaluating their students reading fluency as WCPM(Word Count Per Minute) scores.

The teacher assigns a reading passage and the student is required to record themselves reading the passage aloud. The teacher can later grade passages via the online interface and the student can see both their scores and the words that were marked as incorrectly spoken. The teacher can optionally enable a TTS(Text to Speech)  feature that allows the student to hear the correct pronunciation of the word.
